# Sleeping the Dog

Just throw him in the crate eh!

* If he cries that’s him trying to say that he loves you
* He really likes to cuddle on the bed at night, he would love if you allow a little cuddle time after his last walk before you throw him in the crate
* (Nua cuddles are mostly just him lying at the foot of the bed maybe on top of your feet but sometimes he’s down to spoon)
