# Sleeping the Dog

Just throw him in the crate eh!

He might cry the tiniest bit, that is his way of saying he loves you (but for real even if this does happen he should stop after a minute or two).

He really likes to cuddle on the bed at night, he would love if you allow a little cuddle time after his last walk before you throw him in the crate.

(Nua cuddles are mostly just him lying at the foot of the bed maybe on top of your feet but sometimes heâ€™s down to spoon)
