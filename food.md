# Feeding the Dog

Nua's weird. He allegedy eats twice a day, but really only if he's in the mood, so we just make sure to _offer_ twice a day and try not to stress if he only eats like half of what he's supposed to.

## Morning Food

He eats dry food in the morning!

It's located in a pickle jar to the right of the sink. It's the larger jar with the kibble, not the smaller jar with the cracker-looking things (those are treats, he likes those too).

He eats two full scoops of this food, the scoop is on top of the jar.

He is a jerk so he almost definitely won't eat all of this in the morning; that's ok, just hold on to the rest and try to give it to him at dinner, he'll probably eat it then.

Tip -- he finds eating this more fun if you just scatter a bunch of the kibble pieces on the ground and he gets to collect them.

## Evening Food

He eats refrigerated food in the evening!

It's located on the bottom shelf of the fridge, in little blue-topped glass containers. There should be one container for each night you're looking after him that we've already cut up and measured (it's about 6 ounces of little meat cubes).

For this meal, just grab one of his crazy blue bowls (on top of the fridge) and dump the food into it. The bowls help him not eat too fast. You can also dump in whatever kibble from breakfast he didn't eat.

Then, just set the bowl on the ground somewhere for him. His crate is fine, or whatever.
