# Hanging Out with the Dog

Overall, Nua is very quiet and chill, and will probably just sleep (or stare at you uncomfortably) for most of the day when not walking/etc.

However, he has developed some totally worthless communication tactics for when he does want something.

* If he sits in the middle of the room and starts whining, he almost definitely just wants to be pet
* If he points himself at the balcony and starts whining, he wants to go out on the balcony (this is OK but see below)
* If he noses you forcefully or starts biting stuff, he's probably hungry! You can try giving him some of his breakfast that he undoubtedly did not finish earlier

He loves sitting out on the balcony but if you let him out there please go with him or at least keep a close eye on him, he's never shown any desire to but could easily jump over the railing.

His toys are in the corner by the wicker shelf thing, next to the kitchen island! Keep an eye on him with these too, if he doesn’t bother you for more than a minute or two with one of these it’s probably because he’s trying to remove some piece of it, which again is usually fine, just make sure he doesn’t eat it (he’s quite good about this lol).

If you need to leave him alone in the apartment, this is totally fine! Please put him in the crate, that way we know he won’t get into anything. He's good about this and will probably just curl up! Try not to leave him in there for more than a few hours.
